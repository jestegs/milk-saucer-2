<h2>How I am Thinking About Level Design</h2>
<h3>June 12, 2023</h3>
<p>
This week I spent some time with the images for the Steam page to make them a little more exciting and up to date. I feel like my thoughts on the art style have solidified over the last year and that I’ve felt more confident in creating game assets and “promotional” stuff. Part of that of course is that I’ve learned the tools a little more, and that I have had the time to think about the directions I want to take the project in. The updates are not yet live, mostly because I am waiting to make the trailer, which means that I am looking at tweaking the level design a little bit. The levels have largely stayed the same over the past year, and for me that makes the visuals feel a little old and non-polished. I think they aren’t up to snuff with what a final release should be, and will need a pretty big change eventually, so might as well freshen up some things to better represent the work I have put into it through all this time. 
</p>
<p>
I know that other people probably won’t notice or feel that way, but still. I need it for me and I think that is okay because I’m not really stressing over it. It is just another thing that I want to do as much as the other things, a thing to check off. It’s not going to be something that takes any more effort or time than anything else. But I’m not looking forward to it as much as the other aspects. I am excited to finally get the time to add the final weapon, to fix this bug with the vending machines, test and modify the AI (or just entirely rewrite it), and even create banal objects that will clutter up the scenes, in a good way. There is just something about re-visiting these levels that makes it un-fun. Maybe it is that I have already populated them with characters and objects, and it is difficult to imagine me moving all that stuff around to accept a new layout, even though most of the time I don’t have to move around all that much. Psychological thing, I don’t know. Anyway I am going to add a new weapon soon, tweak the levels a bit, maybe the textures, and then begin recording gameplay for an updated trailer.

<h2>Recent Updates and This Week's Plans</h2>
<h3>May 29, 2023</h3>
<p>
The other day I got some important bug fixes done. The first one had to do with loading the player's inventory correctly, as I noticed things were missing on respawn. At first I figured that it was something to do with improperly saving/loading the items, but I realized I was calling the 'remove item from inventory' function every time an item was picked up, not just the one time when you unholster it. So basically every time you messed around with these items jumping around your inventory screen, you were technically removing the items that were still on your belt. Come time to start a new level, your unfairly trimmed inventory was saved instead of the one that you appeared to have, and when you respawned you almost all the time started with nothing. I presume that fixing this one also fixed a bug where new magazines would be put into already occupied slots, so hopefully that is two problems with one solution.
</p>
<p>
The second little bug was annoying but easier to fix. Turns out I wasn't disabling the mouse when the player leaves an inventory screen, so whatever they were hovering over would be clicked on when they interact with something in the world or shoot a gun, causing weird things like unloading the magazine or unholstering your weapon after every time you shot at something. I just made a global boolean flag that gets turned on and off whenever the player can use their little wiggly arm thing, so that if the player clicks on a grabbable UI object while not in a menu it won't proceed with the code block.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Next week I will update the steam page with some gameplay and new art assets and a better description that suits what the game is about now. It has been a year since I touched that page basically so it can use an update. I feel my ideas and what I want to convey have changed a lot since.

<h2>Doldrums</h2>
<h3>May 28, 2023</h3>
<p>
I have reached a period of stillness in my creative life at the moment. Over the years that I have more seriously undertook art, and through conversations with people and friends, I realize that moments like these are somewhat inevitable. Maybe there is some sort of creative-energy-reservoir inside all of us that depletes and needs to be replenished once in a while, but even that oversimplification makes me uncomfortable. I don’t really know. They just happen.
</p>
<p>
The worst part about it is that I do not feel like I have any control over these bouts of depression. They begin for whatever reason, and continue until they cease and I get those creative juices back, coursing through my body. I try to figure that pushing myself to accomplish smaller goals along the larger steps I had set out for myself will ease me into my usual state of mind, but it almost never works really. I create when I feel creative, and don’t when I don’t. 
</p>
<p>
It is frustrating to acknowledge this indefinite gap in my personal productivity, especially when so much of my life revolves around it, but I believe there is not much else that I can do during times like these to ameliorate it. I try not to feel frustrated, because there is no point. Every once in a while there is a spark, either related or unrelated to the current project, and I pursue it briefly and then give up on it usually. So many things remain unfinished this way. That is disappointing to me. But it is in the revolt that I am made miserable. If I can somehow accept this period where everything pursued is pursued for the moment and not for the future, I feel that I can become encouraged again.
</p>
<p>
Many things go unfinished. When a project in the scope of a couple years is developed, original ideas are tossed aside, and new ideas rapidly blossom to become unexpected additions. The project changes. My inspirations change. My life situations change. I don’t know why it is surprising to me, that things change, but it is. And this surprise I feel naturally turns into frustration, because I don’t think of where these feelings come from. I don’t need to know where these feelings come from, to be honest, I just need to not be made miserable by them. I must acknowledge them to accept them, that is all. Acknowledgment. This is why I have found it to be pretty pointless to set deadlines for myself. I never know when the wind will stop blowing, or when it will pick back up again, just that it will happen, eventually. When it happens, I think that it is important to take advantage of it as much as I can, and maybe when the winds inevitably settle too, I can take advantage of that time to reflect. 
</p>
<p>
The doldrums is an excuse to stop stressing about things, do things for myself, and do things for the short term. There is a moment to practice mindfulness, acceptance, and a moment to try and learn about things that otherwise I would not have the time or interest in. These periodic moments where I cease to feel myself have always scared me, I am scared now. It is like crawling into a cocoon, with the body crying out to change itself into something it wasn’t before. I am comfortable in my life before this moment of uncertainty and dissolution, why would I accept a change now? But if these periods are inevitable, fighting it is pointless. Guidance is different. Moments of change are stressful, uncomfortable, but if you learn how to guide them, they can change you in good ways, you can improve yourself. Don’t harden the rest of you inside the cocoon, let it liquidize and become fluid, see the fluid, recognize everything that it can become, and move toward it. The doldrums are externally motionless, but inside are extremely chaotic and stressful. A ship stuck at sea is still full of seamen all crying out to do something, get home, to eat. But the surface of the water is calm, the sun shines, and nowhere else is there a sound to be made.

<h2>Automatic Test Post</h2>
<h3>April 23, 2023</h3>
<p>
This is a post to test the functionality of a GUI I built for writing blog posts. It automatically formats some plain text from a text editor widget into html and inserts it into the website. There are probably some bugs that I have to work out, but I got the basic functionality down.
</p>
<p>
It is a really simple program because I really just want to avoid writing long blog posts and having to copy/paste them and manually format them to the website, and I didn't want to do anything with Javascript, both because I am unfamiliar with it and I want to the website itself to be as basic as possible. Really simple stuff here.
</p>
<p>
But now I can write longer blog posts, and hopefully eventually get some saving/loading functionality so that I can stop and pick up where I left off later on.
</p>
<p>
I am still not really sure that I am ever going to use this blog, but now that it is easier to write for it I guess I will try. I always feel like I have a lot to say about these projects of mine, and now I have a place to say it. Also a lot of ideas to meditate on that inform my art and my life that maybe someone will find interesting too, and it gives me practice with writing and expression through words.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, this is good. It works. More headache than I wanted but now this is less headache and I'll never have to deal with that headache ever again really. Cool! Time to start coming up with things to write about I guess. Hmm...

            <h3>April 9, 2023</h3>
            <p>
                This is a post to test out the word wrapping and look of a properly long blog 
                post so that I can program a formatter appropriately. So I am using big words and trying
                to type as much as I can here, right now. Not so big I guess, I don't feel very creative
                at the moment, I just want to type something. I like typing, it is fun. Absolutely fun.
                Such a fun activity to fill spaces with text... wow!. Thrilling. I can't believe I am 
                able to do this right now, bless me!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am thinking that this is looking good right now. I am happy with how it is
                coming out. I feel good that I got a lot of work done on this website design today.
                Generally I know what I am going to do with it now, I have been thinking about it a lot.
                The most difficult part is going to be developing the formatter. Design wise, a 
                gallery/portfolio is going to be the most difficult. Figuring out how to statically
                show my work in an easy to navigate way while maintaining some sort of artistic integrity.
                It must be fun, it will be fun. And cool.
            </p>

                Okay. Hello. I am a painter and a videogame developer. Is "videogame" one word or two? 
                For me it is one. It is a single thing, a single concept. A "video game" is something 
                totally different. Two separate concepts. A game played on a video. A VHS game, I wish
                you could make a game played on a VHS tape. Like a choose your own adventure VHS or something.
                A videogame does not have to be video at all, or a game. It is a videogame. Neither and both.
                One and two. Zero and One.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hive fever, all the bees are doing something they shouldn't. Swarming, eating up all the air.
                It is getting so annoying to type because of this stupid IDE thinking I want to copy variable
                names. Fuck off
