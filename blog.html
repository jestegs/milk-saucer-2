<h2>Writing What Was Already Written</h2>
<h3>February 15, 2024</h3>
<p>
I started writing this post last week but got side-tracked.
</p>
<p>
This is the first update for how the re-write is going, and overall it isn't going that poorly. I am trying to re-imagine the code design to be a little more robust and understandable, because upon returning to it many times in the old structure, I was always confused and frustrated by it. I am hoping to both understand it better and make it more 'modular' this second time around. I am unsure whether or not my goal of having the reload system finished by March is realistic, as I have mostly been focusing on physics and item interaction, but that's fine because I don't really have any deadlines yet. A lot of the changes are probably things I don't even need to do, but it feels good to refresh my understanding of how it works since I first wrote these bits two years ago now. 
</p>
<p>
The most significant change I have made so far is in how the PhysicsItems work, specifically how the player interacts with them. Before, the non-physics stuff like detecting the mouse and holding the object was based on using the collision shapes of the rigid body, which made more sense to me at the time. So the item's bounds would enter the drop area, the player would let go, and then something would happen. I am experimenting with having the interaction be based off the mouse instead, so something will only happen if the object is dropped when the mouse is in a significant area, not the object itself. I am hoping that this makes moving items around a little more intuitive and precise, but if it is too awkward I have another fix in mind that I didn't consider before, which is doing a sort of FIFO system with the areas that an object enters. But anyway.
</p>
<p>
Programming is never without its stresses, but I think a lot of the stress I feel is preventable somehow. I often get into these lines of thinking where I feel I don't pause, it is just a continuous streak, and when I encounter a block that I didn't think about, I sweep it up into whatever I am working on, and it either messes everything up, or I forget I even modified it and it messes things up later. Most of the time when this happens I make a small change that only helps one problem, all the while creating others. So I need to get better at recognizing these moods. I have tried writing pseudo-code while at work to plan things out better, but that's tough because I don't really have the overall structure to reference when I am working on it, and I forget what it's like, and then I realize later that I actually can't implement this unless I change everything else. Hopefully that is also something that I can be more on top of with this re-write. This is one of the few larger programs I have written, and I feel like the stakes are somewhat higher for this one, because I am planning to distribute it and want as few bugs and quirks in the structure as possible. I want it to work as intended at least most of the time.
</p>
<p>
I am finding a few hours every week to do some work on this, which is not even close to what I actually want to spend on it, but at least it is something, and somewhat regular. I'll see what I have at the end of this month and hopefully have more information to adjust my expectations for the future.

<h2>A New Year</h2>
<h3>January 10, 2024</h3>
<p>
Now that it's the New Year I wanted to try and organize my thoughts a bit. Goal-setting is not really what I want to do, but moreso go over what I have been able to do in the last twelve months and see how I can somehow extrapolate that into this year. When going through my development journal I was actually kind of surprised at how much I did, which is contrary to what I feel I have done. At the beginning of last year, I did a lot of modeling assets and sketching level designs because that was my priority. I was going to simply add the last couple of weapons and continue on to gameplay design and then be nearly done by 2024 (ha.) Instead a lot of different stuff happened and now I am on a completely different trajectory. 
</p>
<p>
-
</p>
<p>
A big thing that I finished fairly early on was the manual weapon switching, where, instead of pressing 'g' to cycle between five weapons, the player would drag and drop the weapon from their belt to their hands in a separate inventory. Development on this went pretty smoothly. The code was straight forward and most of the work I had to do was handling the art that would support it. I still feel like the UI could be designed better but that is going to be something that I revisit for the whole project later on. 
</p>
<p>
An addition that made me very happy and reinvigorated me a little was creating the oscillating fan. It is one of those mundane things that just struck me as interesting and fun to make and so I did it in a fit of passion. One of the most rewarding ways to do things in my opinion. It encompassed pretty much every aspect of development, from code to handle the animation, 3D modeling and texture work, and sound design. That it touched upon all these aspects was really helpful for strengthening some skills, and combining them together into a finished asset felt like a miniature project in and of itself which was very motivating to me.
</p>
<p>
Last year is also when I started to think about trash in the game, and how to handle the physics a little more interestingly. The trash was always going to crowd the screen, but making it react to the player's movement and other actions is really important for the game feel. To me it feels completely different and it offers a challenge that I think will be fun for the player to solve.
</p>
<p>
I also buckled down and re-coded the vending machine functionality to be extendable and more random, which will help later down the line when I add new items. I would still like to tweak the randomness a little bit, maybe having it favor certain types of items, manually adjusting probabilities, stuff like that. But that is small work that can be done at any time.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the largest addition of last year was the shotgun implementation, which was not a small part of the reason why I began to rethink a lot of the code structure to the game. I thought it would be easier to rip a hole in the game and patch it up to be able to incorporate a new mechanic, but no, it was pretty complicated, and has been making me think the entire game's functionality is now pretty fragile, which in some way is funny. But it is mostly a frustrating thing to consider, despite almost being done with (what I presume to be) the last of the patchwork. The player code is really the only code that I need to preserve, the rest makes up a small part of the game. When I am done with the revolver, I should be done with the player and I will be able to move onto the rest of the stuff that is going to need to be developed.
</p>
<p>
-
</p>
<p>
Now, as for what is to come. My plan is of five parts:
</p>
<ol style="text-align: left">
	<li>finish revolver implementation</li>
	<li>upgrade to Godot 4 (3.4 is going to be ancient by the time this project is done...)</li>
	<li>polish the physics</li>
	<li>add back Qodot</li>
	<li>work on AI and level design</li>
</ol>
<p>
These five points have so many sub-points that I do not want to think about writing them down right now. I think, and hope, that the revolver will be completable in this wonderful month of January even though I have yet to turn on my PC since the first day. At the risk of lying to myself, I don't think there is much I have left, not accounting for the inevitable bug fixes that will have to be done. So that leaves February for upgrading to Godot 4. 
</p>
<p>
Upgrading the engine is important to me because I have been using the same version for a couple years now basically, and since a couple more years is probably going to be the realistic timeframe for a release, I want to have it on software that is somewhat modern. We all know how quickly computers can change. This will also give me an opportunity to begin rewriting the game if I deem that I must. I am going to be rewriting the AI anyway considering that the gameplay design is drastically changing, and Godot 4 has a different navigation system, so I might as well take this opportunity the compile what I have learned about games programming and write the thing better and more prudently. 
</p>
<p>
After the engine update/program rewrite, I am going to really hammer down the physics. Things are a little finicky at the moment, and since the physics are what the players are going to be interacting with the most (it is fundamentally the entire game!) I want it to feel great. 
</p>
<p>
Then I am going to add back Qodot to the mix, as I will be removing almost everything except the reloading system during the upgrade. Qodot has been a fantastic help and I highly recommend it if you want to use Trenchbroom as a level editor for Godot. I plan to keep using it as it is the only level editor that I know how to use, and also seems the most intuitive/quick to develop ideas for. I tried Hammer a long time ago and it was confusing to me, Trenchbroom I picked up right away.
</p>
<p>
After that it will be level design and AI (they kind of go hand in hand), and of course making more assets for sprucing up the levels. There are a lot of things that need to happen in between this stuff, so I am honestly not expecting to get it all finished this year. I also just don't want to set unrealistic expectations for myself. Unrealism can either go too far or not far enough, but if I get the upgrade done I will feel very satisfied, and that is something I can't imagine taking much longer than a few months, barring life events and mental health.
</p>
<p>
I am feeling very confident about the projected project this year, and I am excited to continue. Now that I have somewhat of a system for writing blog posts and keeping updates on things that I can't really show off in the same way, I am also confident that I can keep a schedule of updates. Once a month is going fine so far, even though this is like the third or fourth month; there is always plenty to talk about and plenty of time to mentally prepare myself for getting *something* done. Thank you for caring enough to read this, and to everyone for caring enough at all about the project to continue expressing interest in it. You have been a big motivator for me to finish this <3.

<h2>Ritual</h2>
<h3>December 4, 2023</h3>
<p>
So my goals since the last post here have yet to be met. At the beginning of last month I was expecting to have the revolver completely finished and added to the game, and by this month already have begun on level design, or enemy behavior, or writing, or anything other than stitching together poorly-thought-out code (which I am exhausted from by now.) Alas, I still have a significant portion of the revolver left to go. I need to add the bullets into the UI, make the extractor work, and have the hammer function appropriately. I am still debating with myself whether to add the 3D animations in now or later. The only reason I want to work on it now is so that I don't forget how my code works, which has partly been the problem of taking too much time off. But also, I'm just not thrilled with putting the effort in to make it happen at this point, so I'm going to move on to something I find more thrilling. I'm tired of going back and forth through the same script files. 
</p>
<p>
For about a month I didn't work on the game at all, which is kind of scary to me. It's not that I am in a rush or anything, but I would like to have progress pretty consistently, if nothing else but for my mental health; I want the feeling like I am doing something, exercising my mind, expressing myself. For me, at this point, I haven't really found a different creative outlet that hits the same marks. It is strange to me to flick between gamedev projects instead of just focusing on one when I am the only developer of both. Game development hasn't been a general thing for the past couple years, it is always in the context of GossMat, and switching gears per se is not a comfortable thing I can do. Any time I sit down to do something creative on my computer I think, "I could be doing work on Gossamer Matrix instead" and move to that. So, the fact that I haven't really worked on it in a month or so is concerning to me.
</p>
<p>
I have been thinking of ways I can work that get me into the groove a bit more. I miss those development sessions that went several hours beyond what I had planned because I simply couldn't pull myself away. I don't know if those were healthy really, they were sometimes stressful, but rewarding to a degree that I haven't felt with anything else. And now that I am at the opposite end of that production schedule (which I think is just as stressful but in a different way), I want to get back to development with a more intentional approach. 
</p>
<p>
One of the other game ideas I have been brainstorming has to do with spirituality and conducting ritual, and I have been wondering to what extent I can include those more into my life. I think there is something of spirituality in any creative project, especially ones that last this long, but I am lacking the ritual aspect. This blog is something of an attempt at using ritual to be more intentional and regular and attuned to this project. A space where I have to think about something specific, stay on topic, put effort into staying on track and not letting my mind completely wander. I makes me feel good to have these posts to look back to as well. I am going to try and make a post at the beginning of each month from now on, whether or not I make any progress on developing the game. I will have at least made progress on how I think about making the game, and that is important too, and something that I can apply anywhere, not just to GossMat or videogames. I want to think of this space not as a place to provide updates on any particular project, but more so how I approach creative things in general.

<h2>Few and Far Between</h2>
<h3>October 7, 2023</h3>
<p>
In August I made a major update, which was adding the shotgun. It was a lot more under-the-hood work than I expected, but the result is exactly what I wanted, and it will make adding the revolver easier hopefully - if not just for the fact that I understand my own code better than I did before. Since the shotgun I have made significant progress toward adding the revolver, finishing all but a couple of the assets that I need for the UI. I still have to do all the coding and importing, but I can do that all at once.
</p>
<p>
This is how updates have been going generally: big bursts of energy because I rarely get the time to work on it due to the dynamic responsibilities of life. At first, about a year ago, I was really uncomfortable with this idea; it was new to me, and the grinding halt of creative precipitate made me worried. Now it is a normal thing that I have dealt with every day, and I'm feeling less anxious about it. I am often disappointed in myself, but no longer anxious; I'm no longer feeling like I need a deadline, or need to consider every possible thing. I can focus on it a bit at a time. I am finding that having more of a structure is very helpful now. Before, I could spend eight hours of my day creating, and I had the time to execute an idea as soon as it popped up, to derail. Now that that time is spread out, I forget about things and need to write them down. I need to slot them into the general plan that I have.
</p>
<p>
Another thing that seems to be a consequence of this new method of working is that my mind is wandering to different ideas. To be honest, the idea for Gossamer Matrix was pretty spontaneous, and so was the popularity which put pressure on me to continue developing it. Which, to be clear, is very welcome and if not for the interest of other people it would have fell flat. I love working on it, and it is the first time that I can actually focus on one project and not stray from it. So, thank you, deeply; I have learned so much. But nothing else about the project was thought out, at all. It all came from me hastily needing some sort of context. With all of these other ideas my mind has wandered to while developing gossMat, I have had a base. There is a life to these other ideas. Things that grew and died and left the soil ripe for better, stronger ideas to grow in their place. With these secondary ideas I don't feel pressure to get something solid developed first. The spontaneity behind gossMat is a beautiful part of it, but maybe I am feeling stale from it. I think both approaches have merit, and of course this type of stuff is nuanced, but Gossamer Matrix feels plastic to me whereas these other games are alive in my head and organic. 
</p>

</p>
<p>
Anyway, the 'plan' for October is to get the revolver, the final weapon, added to the game. Then I can move onto boring stuff like making sure the game saves correctly and how levels will unlock. I shouldn't say boring I guess, it is interesting in it's own way. I mean that it really isn't the type of creativity I can have fun with. It is creative for sure, it is problem solving, and you can take liberties with it as well, and it is a fundamental part of the way the game feels; players will completely change strategies based solely on how a game is saved. I guess that is another idea for a different game....

<h2>Learning to Program</h2>
<h3>August 20, 2023</h3>
<p>
Recently, last week, I finished most of the shotgun implementation that I have been mentally building up to for months it seems. By most I mean it's all there, except for the charging handle behavior that's a little wonky. Anyway, it took a while because I very carefully had to squeeze in this new code, new functionality, for the weapon system in order to correctly incorporate this new weapon. Usually, I feel like I can just build on top of whatever I created and it usually works pretty well, but this is the biggest project I have worked on yet, and the weapon code is something that I didn't touch since a year ago. Extending the weapon code was not as simple as adding a new weapon in the past, because the shotgun uses an internal magazine, and the shells (in this case, the physics objects that will bounce around the screen) aren't magazines, they are shells. Because the weapon system is based on external magazines only, the magazine (which is usually transient) had to be made to function as a permanent part of the weapon, and the shells had to be magazines, but with just one bullet.
</p>
<p>
With the way things currently are, and will hopefully not change, the shells are Magazine objects, so they can bounce around the screen just like the other magazines, and can be thrown away when their ammo is spent. However, because, technically, there are multiple magazines 'attached' to the shotgun at one time in order to load multiple shells, they turn invisible and are disabled and simply sit on the reload screen until the charging handle is pulled back. I extended the Magazine class in a couple ways: one, to override any features that the Shells didn't need; and two, to create an InternalMagazine that keeps track of objects instead of keeping an integer tally, so the type of shell could be saved as well (I have slugs and standard shot).
</p>
<p>
I have studied object-oriented programming for years, and the program I have now I could never imagine using in the past, there are so many things tacked on because I was impatient and too excited. But to fix them now would be to restructure the whole thing, and so many different parts have been lazily tied together at this point that I would need to search for and rewrite a lot in order to make it work. So I will not do that. The program works, and that is really all that matters to me at the moment. Optimizing performance interests me, but it will never be so expensive that it is something I need worry about. There is a certain dizzying, intoxicating element to writing a program that works, but is also awfully confusing when you get down to the threads that I love.

<h2>Patchwork in the Game Cloth</h2>
<h3>June 21, 2023</h3>
<p>
Spent some time making assets for the shotgun this week. This is going to be the final weapon I add probably, making the total number 4. I am thinking a bit about making the silenced handgun a revolver just to add a little more variety, which I think the reload system needs, but it seems a little silly. I don't know the whole game is silly, it's just another one of those hang ups I have on things, I catch myself thinking too realistically sometimes, not spontaneous enough. Hell, I'll change it to a revolver next.
</p>
<p>
Beside that aside, yes, all the gun assets are done! I didn't really want to do that part because it involved a lot of technical, time consuming, non-creative stuff, like breaking the icon for the reload into separate parts, or making the hands shape correctly to the gun and having the gun positioned correctly in the hands. It also involved modifying the code a bit to include a new weapon. The big code modification is coming up next though, the actual functionality of it. I must set aside a several hour block to do it one of these days, just so I can work on it all in one go and make sure I have extra time to buffer it if something unexpected happens, which it always does. That is the only way I can comfortably start working on a coding project: if I don't have a time to beat. 
</p>
<p>
It is this patchwork feeling I don't really like doing. I like coding an idea from a fresh start, or in a way which can be isolated from the rest of the code. It is probably my fault for not planning ahead so much, but everything eventually gets all tangled up and attached to each other that I must navigate to so many different places and make little small, identical changes. And then I miss something, and thank goodness the project is small because it would take forever to debug every issue that I miss. Again, there are probably technologies and techniques that I can learn to prevent this from happening, but that is boring. I am making a game because it is a fun and interesting process, nothing more. I've learned a lot from it so far, will learn more, and will never learn everything. I can make some compromises. The second this stops being worth it I will quit, but as of right now this has been worth every second spent.

<h2>How I am Thinking About Level Design</h2>
<h3>June 12, 2023</h3>
<p>
This week I spent some time with the images for the Steam page to make them a little more exciting and up to date. I feel like my thoughts on the art style have solidified over the last year and that I've felt more confident in creating game assets and 'promotional' stuff. Part of that of course is that I've learned the tools a little more, and that I have had the time to think about the directions I want to take the project in. The updates are not yet live, mostly because I am waiting to make the trailer, which means that I am looking at tweaking the level design a little bit. The levels have largely stayed the same over the past year, and for me that makes the visuals feel a little old and non-polished. I think they aren't up to snuff with what a final release should be, and will need a pretty big change eventually, so might as well freshen up some things to better represent the work I have put into it through all this time. 
</p>
<p>
I know that other people probably won't notice or feel that way, but still. I need it for me and I think that is okay because I'm not really stressing over it. It is just another thing that I want to do as much as the other things, a thing to check off. It's not going to be something that takes any more effort or time than anything else. But I'm not looking forward to it as much as the other aspects. I am excited to finally get the time to add the final weapon, to fix this bug with the vending machines, test and modify the AI (or just entirely rewrite it), and even create banal objects that will clutter up the scenes, in a good way. There is just something about re-visiting these levels that makes it un-fun. Maybe it is that I have already populated them with characters and objects, and it is difficult to imagine me moving all that stuff around to accept a new layout, even though most of the time I don't have to move around all that much. Psychological thing, I don't know. Anyway I am going to add a new weapon soon, tweak the levels a bit, maybe the textures, and then begin recording gameplay for an updated trailer.
</p>

<h2>Recent Updates and This Week's Plans</h2>
<h3>May 29, 2023</h3>
<p>
The other day I got some important bug fixes done. The first one had to do with loading the player's inventory correctly, as I noticed things were missing on respawn. At first I figured that it was something to do with improperly saving/loading the items, but I realized I was calling the 'remove item from inventory' function every time an item was picked up, not just the one time when you unholster it. So basically every time you messed around with these items jumping around your inventory screen, you were technically removing the items that were still on your belt. Come time to start a new level, your unfairly trimmed inventory was saved instead of the one that you appeared to have, and when you respawned you almost all the time started with nothing. I presume that fixing this one also fixed a bug where new magazines would be put into already occupied slots, so hopefully that is two problems with one solution.
</p>
<p>
The second little bug was annoying but easier to fix. Turns out I wasn't disabling the mouse when the player leaves an inventory screen, so whatever they were hovering over would be clicked on when they interact with something in the world or shoot a gun, causing weird things like unloading the magazine or unholstering your weapon after every time you shot at something. I just made a global boolean flag that gets turned on and off whenever the player can use their little wiggly arm thing, so that if the player clicks on a grabbable UI object while not in a menu it won't proceed with the code block.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Next week I will update the steam page with some gameplay and new art assets and a better description that suits what the game is about now. It has been a year since I touched that page basically so it can use an update. I feel my ideas and what I want to convey have changed a lot since.

<h2>Doldrums</h2>
<h3>May 28, 2023</h3>
<p>
I have reached a period of stillness in my creative life at the moment. Over the years that I have more seriously undertook art, and through conversations with people and friends, I realize that moments like these are somewhat inevitable. Maybe there is some sort of creative-energy-reservoir inside all of us that depletes and needs to be replenished once in a while, but even that oversimplification makes me uncomfortable. I don�t really know. They just happen.
</p>
<p>
The worst part about it is that I do not feel like I have any control over these bouts of depression. They begin for whatever reason, and continue until they cease and I get those creative juices back, coursing through my body. I try to figure that pushing myself to accomplish smaller goals along the larger steps I had set out for myself will ease me into my usual state of mind, but it almost never works really. I create when I feel creative, and don�t when I don�t. 
</p>
<p>
It is frustrating to acknowledge this indefinite gap in my personal productivity, especially when so much of my life revolves around it, but I believe there is not much else that I can do during times like these to ameliorate it. I try not to feel frustrated, because there is no point. Every once in a while there is a spark, either related or unrelated to the current project, and I pursue it briefly and then give up on it usually. So many things remain unfinished this way. That is disappointing to me. But it is in the revolt that I am made miserable. If I can somehow accept this period where everything pursued is pursued for the moment and not for the future, I feel that I can become encouraged again.
</p>
<p>
Many things go unfinished. When a project in the scope of a couple years is developed, original ideas are tossed aside, and new ideas rapidly blossom to become unexpected additions. The project changes. My inspirations change. My life situations change. I don�t know why it is surprising to me, that things change, but it is. And this surprise I feel naturally turns into frustration, because I don�t think of where these feelings come from. I don�t need to know where these feelings come from, to be honest, I just need to not be made miserable by them. I must acknowledge them to accept them, that is all. Acknowledgment. This is why I have found it to be pretty pointless to set deadlines for myself. I never know when the wind will stop blowing, or when it will pick back up again, just that it will happen, eventually. When it happens, I think that it is important to take advantage of it as much as I can, and maybe when the winds inevitably settle too, I can take advantage of that time to reflect.

The doldrums is an excuse to stop stressing about things, do things for myself, and do things for the short term. There is a moment to practice mindfulness, acceptance, and a moment to try and learn about things that otherwise I would not have the time or interest in. These periodic moments where I cease to feel myself have always scared me, I am scared now. It is like crawling into a cocoon, with the body crying out to change itself into something it wasn�t before. I am comfortable in my life before this moment of uncertainty and dissolution, why would I accept a change now? But if these periods are inevitable, fighting it is pointless. Guidance is different. Moments of change are stressful, uncomfortable, but if you learn how to guide them, they can change you in good ways, you can improve yourself. Don�t harden the rest of you inside the cocoon, let it liquidize and become fluid, see the fluid, recognize everything that it can become, and move toward it. The doldrums are externally motionless, but inside are extremely chaotic and stressful. A ship stuck at sea is still full of seamen all crying out to do something, get home, to eat. But the surface of the water is calm, the sun shines, and nowhere else is there a sound to be made.
