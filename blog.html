<h2>Learning to Program</h2>
<h3>August 20, 2023</h3>
<p>
Recently, last week, I finished most of the shotgun implementation that I have been mentally building up to for months it seems. By most I mean it's all there, except for the charging handle behavior that's a little wonky. Anyway, it took a while because I very carefully had to squeeze in this new code, new functionality, for the weapon system in order to correctly incorporate this new weapon. Usually, I feel like I can just build on top of whatever I created and it usually works pretty well, but this is the biggest project I have worked on yet, and the weapon code is something that I didn't touch since a year ago. Extending the weapon code was not as simple as adding a new weapon in the past, because the shotgun uses an internal magazine, and the shells (in this case, the physics objects that will bounce around the screen) aren't magazines, they are shells. Because the weapon system is based on external magazines only, the magazine (which is usually transient) had to be made to function as a permanent part of the weapon, and the shells had to be magazines, but with just one bullet.
</p>
<p>
With the way things currently are, and will hopefully not change, the shells are Magazine objects, so they can bounce around the screen just like the other magazines, and can be thrown away when their ammo is spent. However, because, technically, there are multiple magazines 'attached' to the shotgun at one time in order to load multiple shells, they turn invisible and are disabled and simply sit on the reload screen until the charging handle is pulled back. I extended the Magazine class in a couple ways: one, to override any features that the Shells didn't need; and two, to create an InternalMagazine that keeps track of objects instead of keeping an integer tally, so the type of shell could be saved as well (I have slugs and standard shot).
</p>
<p>
I have studied object-oriented programming for years, and the program I have now I could never imagine using in the past, there are so many things tacked on because I was impatient and too excited. But to fix them now would be to restructure the whole thing, and so many different parts have been lazily tied together at this point that I would need to search for and rewrite a lot in order to make it work. So I will not do that. The program works, and that is really all that matters to me at the moment. Optimizing performance interests me, but it will never be so expensive that it is something I need worry about. There is a certain dizzying, intoxicating element to writing a program that works, but is also awfully confusing when you get down to the threads that I love. A spider's web is beautiful, but the pattern it makes is obvious. There is a secret I keep from everyone, and it is kept in the labyrinth of words which sing Gossamer Matrix.

<h2>Patchwork in the Game Cloth</h2>
<h3>June 21, 2023</h3>
<p>
Spent some time making assets for the shotgun this week. This is going to be the final weapon I add probably, making the total number 4. I am thinking a bit about making the silenced handgun a revolver just to add a little more variety, which I think the reload system needs, but it seems a little silly. I don't know the whole game is silly, it's just another one of those hang ups I have on things, I catch myself thinking too realistically sometimes, not spontaneous enough. Hell, I'll change it to a revolver next.
</p>
<p>
Beside that aside, yes, all the gun assets are done! I didn't really want to do that part because it involved a lot of technical, time consuming, non-creative stuff, like breaking the icon for the reload into separate parts, or making the hands shape correctly to the gun and having the gun positioned correctly in the hands. It also involved modifying the code a bit to include a new weapon. The big code modification is coming up next though, the actual functionality of it. I must set aside a several hour block to do it one of these days, just so I can work on it all in one go and make sure I have extra time to buffer it if something unexpected happens, which it always does. That is the only way I can comfortably start working on a coding project: if I don't have a time to beat. 
</p>
<p>
It is this patchwork feeling I don't really like doing. I like coding an idea from a fresh start, or in a way which can be isolated from the rest of the code. It is probably my fault for not planning ahead so much, but everything eventually gets all tangled up and attached to each other that I must navigate to so many different places and make little small, identical changes. And then I miss something, and thank goodness the project is small because it would take forever to debug every issue that I miss. Again, there are probably technologies and techniques that I can learn to prevent this from happening, but that is boring. I am making a game because it is a fun and interesting process, nothing more. I've learned a lot from it so far, will learn more, and will never learn everything. I can make some compromises. The second this stops being worth it I will quit, but as of right now this has been worth every second spent.

<h2>How I am Thinking About Level Design</h2>
<h3>June 12, 2023</h3>
<p>
This week I spent some time with the images for the Steam page to make them a little more exciting and up to date. I feel like my thoughts on the art style have solidified over the last year and that I've felt more confident in creating game assets and 'promotional' stuff. Part of that of course is that I've learned the tools a little more, and that I have had the time to think about the directions I want to take the project in. The updates are not yet live, mostly because I am waiting to make the trailer, which means that I am looking at tweaking the level design a little bit. The levels have largely stayed the same over the past year, and for me that makes the visuals feel a little old and non-polished. I think they aren't up to snuff with what a final release should be, and will need a pretty big change eventually, so might as well freshen up some things to better represent the work I have put into it through all this time. 
</p>
<p>
I know that other people probably won't notice or feel that way, but still. I need it for me and I think that is okay because I'm not really stressing over it. It is just another thing that I want to do as much as the other things, a thing to check off. It's not going to be something that takes any more effort or time than anything else. But I'm not looking forward to it as much as the other aspects. I am excited to finally get the time to add the final weapon, to fix this bug with the vending machines, test and modify the AI (or just entirely rewrite it), and even create banal objects that will clutter up the scenes, in a good way. There is just something about re-visiting these levels that makes it un-fun. Maybe it is that I have already populated them with characters and objects, and it is difficult to imagine me moving all that stuff around to accept a new layout, even though most of the time I don't have to move around all that much. Psychological thing, I don't know. Anyway I am going to add a new weapon soon, tweak the levels a bit, maybe the textures, and then begin recording gameplay for an updated trailer.

<h2>Recent Updates and This Week's Plans</h2>
<h3>May 29, 2023</h3>
<p>
The other day I got some important bug fixes done. The first one had to do with loading the player's inventory correctly, as I noticed things were missing on respawn. At first I figured that it was something to do with improperly saving/loading the items, but I realized I was calling the 'remove item from inventory' function every time an item was picked up, not just the one time when you unholster it. So basically every time you messed around with these items jumping around your inventory screen, you were technically removing the items that were still on your belt. Come time to start a new level, your unfairly trimmed inventory was saved instead of the one that you appeared to have, and when you respawned you almost all the time started with nothing. I presume that fixing this one also fixed a bug where new magazines would be put into already occupied slots, so hopefully that is two problems with one solution.
</p>
<p>
The second little bug was annoying but easier to fix. Turns out I wasn't disabling the mouse when the player leaves an inventory screen, so whatever they were hovering over would be clicked on when they interact with something in the world or shoot a gun, causing weird things like unloading the magazine or unholstering your weapon after every time you shot at something. I just made a global boolean flag that gets turned on and off whenever the player can use their little wiggly arm thing, so that if the player clicks on a grabbable UI object while not in a menu it won't proceed with the code block.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Next week I will update the steam page with some gameplay and new art assets and a better description that suits what the game is about now. It has been a year since I touched that page basically so it can use an update. I feel my ideas and what I want to convey have changed a lot since.

<h2>Doldrums</h2>
<h3>May 28, 2023</h3>
<p>
I have reached a period of stillness in my creative life at the moment. Over the years that I have more seriously undertook art, and through conversations with people and friends, I realize that moments like these are somewhat inevitable. Maybe there is some sort of creative-energy-reservoir inside all of us that depletes and needs to be replenished once in a while, but even that oversimplification makes me uncomfortable. I don�t really know. They just happen.
</p>
<p>
The worst part about it is that I do not feel like I have any control over these bouts of depression. They begin for whatever reason, and continue until they cease and I get those creative juices back, coursing through my body. I try to figure that pushing myself to accomplish smaller goals along the larger steps I had set out for myself will ease me into my usual state of mind, but it almost never works really. I create when I feel creative, and don�t when I don�t. 
</p>
<p>
It is frustrating to acknowledge this indefinite gap in my personal productivity, especially when so much of my life revolves around it, but I believe there is not much else that I can do during times like these to ameliorate it. I try not to feel frustrated, because there is no point. Every once in a while there is a spark, either related or unrelated to the current project, and I pursue it briefly and then give up on it usually. So many things remain unfinished this way. That is disappointing to me. But it is in the revolt that I am made miserable. If I can somehow accept this period where everything pursued is pursued for the moment and not for the future, I feel that I can become encouraged again.
</p>
<p>
Many things go unfinished. When a project in the scope of a couple years is developed, original ideas are tossed aside, and new ideas rapidly blossom to become unexpected additions. The project changes. My inspirations change. My life situations change. I don�t know why it is surprising to me, that things change, but it is. And this surprise I feel naturally turns into frustration, because I don�t think of where these feelings come from. I don�t need to know where these feelings come from, to be honest, I just need to not be made miserable by them. I must acknowledge them to accept them, that is all. Acknowledgment. This is why I have found it to be pretty pointless to set deadlines for myself. I never know when the wind will stop blowing, or when it will pick back up again, just that it will happen, eventually. When it happens, I think that it is important to take advantage of it as much as I can, and maybe when the winds inevitably settle too, I can take advantage of that time to reflect. 
</p>
<p>
The doldrums is an excuse to stop stressing about things, do things for myself, and do things for the short term. There is a moment to practice mindfulness, acceptance, and a moment to try and learn about things that otherwise I would not have the time or interest in. These periodic moments where I cease to feel myself have always scared me, I am scared now. It is like crawling into a cocoon, with the body crying out to change itself into something it wasn�t before. I am comfortable in my life before this moment of uncertainty and dissolution, why would I accept a change now? But if these periods are inevitable, fighting it is pointless. Guidance is different. Moments of change are stressful, uncomfortable, but if you learn how to guide them, they can change you in good ways, you can improve yourself. Don�t harden the rest of you inside the cocoon, let it liquidize and become fluid, see the fluid, recognize everything that it can become, and move toward it. The doldrums are externally motionless, but inside are extremely chaotic and stressful. A ship stuck at sea is still full of seamen all crying out to do something, get home, to eat. But the surface of the water is calm, the sun shines, and nowhere else is there a sound to be made.
