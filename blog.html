<h2>Automatic Test Post</h2>
<h3>April 23, 2023</h3>
<p>
This is a post to test the functionality of a GUI I built for writing blog posts. It automatically formats some plain text from a text editor widget into html and inserts it into the website. There are probably some bugs that I have to work out, but I got the basic functionality down.
</p>
<p>
It is a really simple program because I really just want to avoid writing long blog posts and having to copy/paste them and manually format them to the website, and I didn't want to do anything with Javascript, both because I am unfamiliar with it and I want to the website itself to be as basic as possible. Really simple stuff here.
</p>
<p>
But now I can write longer blog posts, and hopefully eventually get some saving/loading functionality so that I can stop and pick up where I left off later on.
</p>
<p>
I am still not really sure that I am ever going to use this blog, but now that it is easier to write for it I guess I will try. I always feel like I have a lot to say about these projects of mine, and now I have a place to say it. Also a lot of ideas to meditate on that inform my art and my life that maybe someone will find interesting too, and it gives me practice with writing and expression through words.
</p>
<p>
So yeah, this is good. It works. More headache than I wanted but now this is less headache and I'll never have to deal with that headache ever again really. Cool! Time to start coming up with things to write about I guess. Hmm...

                I feel that I am finally getting a better grasp on the scope of this project, and well...

                This is a post to test out the word wrapping and look of a properly long blog 
                post so that I can program a formatter appropriately. So I am using big words and trying
                to type as much as I can here, right now. Not so big I guess, I don't feel very creative
                at the moment, I just want to type something. I like typing, it is fun. Absolutely fun.
                Such a fun activity to fill spaces with text... wow!. Thrilling. I can't believe I am 
                able to do this right now, bless me!
            </p>
            <p>
                I am thinking that this is looking good right now. I am happy with how it is
                coming out. I feel good that I got a lot of work done on this website design today.
                Generally I know what I am going to do with it now, I have been thinking about it a lot.
                The most difficult part is going to be developing the formatter. Design wise, a 
                gallery/portfolio is going to be the most difficult. Figuring out how to statically
                show my work in an easy to navigate way while maintaining some sort of artistic integrity.
                It must be fun, it will be fun. And cool.

                Okay. Hello. I am a painter and a videogame developer. Is "videogame" one word or two? 
                For me it is one. It is a single thing, a single concept. A "video game" is something 
                totally different. Two separate concepts. A game played on a video. A VHS game, I wish
                you could make a game played on a VHS tape. Like a choose your own adventure VHS or something.
                A videogame does not have to be video at all, or a game. It is a videogame. Neither and both.
                One and two. Zero and One.

                Hive fever, all the bees are doing something they shouldn't. Swarming, eating up all the air.
                It is getting so annoying to type because of this stupid IDE thinking I want to copy variable
                names. Fuck off
