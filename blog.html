                This is a post to test out the word wrapping and look of a properly long blog 
                post so that I can program a formatter appropriately. So I am using big words and trying
                to type as much as I can here, right now. Not so big I guess, I don't feel very creative
                at the moment, I just want to type something. I like typing, it is fun. Absolutely fun.
                Such a fun activity to fill spaces with text... wow!. Thrilling. I can't believe I am 
                able to do this right now, bless me!
            </p>

                I am thinking that this is looking good right now. I am happy with how it is
                coming out. I feel good that I got a lot of work done on this website design today.
                Generally I know what I am going to do with it now, I have been thinking about it a lot.
                The most difficult part is going to be developing the formatter. Design wise, a 
                gallery/portfolio is going to be the most difficult. Figuring out how to statically
                show my work in an easy to navigate way while maintaining some sort of artistic integrity.
                It must be fun, it will be fun. And cool.

                Okay. Hello. I am a painter and a videogame developer. Is "videogame" one word or two? 
                For me it is one. It is a single thing, a single concept. A "video game" is something 
                totally different. Two separate concepts. A game played on a video. A VHS game, I wish
                you could make a game played on a VHS tape. Like a choose your own adventure VHS or something.
                A videogame does not have to be video at all, or a game. It is a videogame. Neither and both.
                One and two. Zero and One.

                Hive fever, all the bees are doing something they shouldn't. Swarming, eating up all the air.
                It is getting so annoying to type because of this stupid IDE thinking I want to copy variable
                names. Fuck off
